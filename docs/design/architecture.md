# Architecture Design

Status: implemented foundation with deferred follow-up work

This document describes the implemented modifier, animation, interaction, theme, presentation, and root extension foundation, followed by explicitly identified follow-up work. Code examples in implemented sections match the current public API.

Current implementation status:

- Generic View modifiers, node extension reconciliation, frame callbacks, pointer observation, foreground painting, and third-party descriptors are implemented.
- ScrollBar animation, hit testing, dragging, and painting are implemented as a node extension without Runtime feature branches.
- Typed Environment, direct Theme providers, nested Theme propagation, and reduced-motion animation resolution are implemented.
- RuntimeRoot, LayerStack ordering, independent application and layer invalidation, RootHook services, and typed presentation handles are implemented.
- Dialog, BottomSheet, Popup, Menu, and Toast share that LayerStack foundation. Standard Dialog structure and Dialog, BottomSheet, Menu, and Toast visual policy resolve from Theme, while BottomSheet dragging remains follow-up work.
- Tween and spring animated Offset, Opacity, Scale, and Rotation values, state-overlay indication, and multi-pointer ripple indication are implemented.
- Node-local PaintSequence recording and reuse, stable RenderNode ownership and revisions, retained group opacity, RenderScene publication, damage calculation, and renderer traversal are implemented.
- General View exit transitions, keyframes, decay animation, advanced Toast queue policy, BottomSheet drag behavior, and profiler timelines remain follow-up work. Dialog, BottomSheet, Menu, and Toast already retain their Layer entries through component-specific exit motion when their active style enables it.

The design has four goals:

- Keep the common View API small and declarative.
- Give built-in and third-party features the same extension mechanisms.
- Preserve mounted state across recomposition without adding feature-specific branches to `Runtime`.
- Reuse the existing Scope, Composer, reconciliation, layout, event, and virtual layout systems.

## Architecture overview

Each window owns one internal runtime root:

```text
RuntimeRoot
├── Root Environment
├── application MountedNode tree
└── Layer stack
    ├── popup entries
    ├── modal entries
    ├── toast entries
    └── system entries
```

The application still starts with the existing shape:

```cpp
HUXERUI_APP(App, {})
```

`RuntimeRoot` is synthesized by the Runtime. It is not a public layout component and does not require applications to wrap their root View.

The main data flow is:

```text
State / Environment changes
    ↓
dirty RecomposeScope
    ↓
ViewSpec and ModifierSpec
    ↓
reconciliation
    ↓
MountedNode and NodeExtension
    ↓
frame, measure, layout, hit testing, and paint
    ↓
RenderScene
```

## Public View surface

The current `View` API has four primary extension points:

```cpp
class View {
public:
  template <ViewModifier... Modifiers>
  View With(Modifiers&&... modifiers) &&;

  template <EventKey Key, class Handler>
  View On(Handler&& handler) &&;

  template <LayoutValueKey Key>
  View LayoutValue(typename Key::Value value) &&;

  View Key(ViewKey key) &&;
};
```

`OnClick()` remains a high-frequency convenience wrapper for the typed event API:

```cpp
template <class Handler>
View OnClick(Handler&& handler) &&
{
  return std::move(*this).On<ViewEvents::Click>(
      std::forward<Handler>(handler));
}
```

Visual effects, interaction behavior, animation, presentation, and parent layout data are modifier values passed to `With()`:

```cpp
return Button("Save")
    .With(
        Padding{12.0F},
        Frame{
            .width = 120.0F,
            .height = 44.0F,
        },
        Background{Colors::Blue},
        CornerRadius{8.0F})
    .OnClick([=] {
      Save();
    });
```

The variadic form keeps common declarations compact:

```cpp
return Text("Hello").With(
    FontSize{18.0F},
    Foreground{Colors::White},
    Padding{12.0F},
    Background{Colors::Blue});
```

It also gives third-party modifiers the same syntax as built-in modifiers:

```cpp
return Card().With(
    ThirdParty::Glow{
        .color = Colors::Cyan,
        .radius = 16.0F,
    });
```

The current API does not require a dedicated `View` member function for every new modifier type.

### Modifier order

Modifiers are processed from left to right, but the current property modifiers do not form wrapper nodes. `Padding`, `Frame`, `Background`, `Foreground`, `FontSize`, alignment, spacing, and similar values apply directly to `ViewSpec`. A later modifier that writes the same property wins. `Frame` merges only explicitly supplied width, height, minimum, and maximum fields so independent declarations can constrain separate axes.

```cpp
view.With(
    Padding{12.0F},
    Background{Colors::Blue});
view.With(
    Background{Colors::Blue},
    Padding{12.0F});
```

These declarations currently produce the same padding and background. They do not express inner and outer backgrounds.

`Frame(width, height)` is the positional fixed-size form. Its six optional fields also support a single preferred axis and independent minimum or maximum bounds. The runtime validates local bounds when the modifier is applied, then intersects them with the parent `Constraints` before measuring content. Preferred dimensions collapse the resulting range to the closest permitted value. Frame constraints describe the outer node size, so Padding is deflated only after the frame range has been resolved.

Grow is a parent layout policy rather than a frame constraint. Row and Column divide finite remaining main-axis space by grow factor and pass each grow child a tight allocation. An unbounded main axis has no remaining extent to divide, so Grow does not expand there.

Flow uses the same public `Layout<Derived>` protocol as Row, Column, and Stack. It first measures children at their natural widths to form horizontal lines, then distributes finite remaining width among Grow children within each line. Main alignment is resolved separately per line, cross alignment applies within the line height, and the common Spacing value is used for both item and line gaps. An unbounded width produces one intrinsic-width line without Grow expansion.

Retained modifiers such as `ScrollBar`, `Indication`, animated `Opacity`, and third-party modifiers with an extension preserve their relative order. Compatible retained entries reconcile by descriptor and position. Frame and foreground paint callbacks run in declaration order, while extension hit testing runs in reverse order.

## Modifier descriptions and node extensions

There are two modifier categories:

- A property modifier applies its value directly to `ViewSpec` and is not retained afterward.
- A retained modifier stores a type-erased `ModifierSpec` in `ViewSpec` and a persistent `NodeExtension` in `MountedNode`.

Conceptually:

```text
Padding / Background ── apply ──▶ ViewSpec properties

Ripple / ScrollBar / Glow
    └── type erasure ──▶ ModifierSpec
                            └── reconciliation ──▶ NodeExtension
```

Each modifier type has a stable descriptor identity. Reconciliation compares modifier type and position:

- A compatible modifier updates its existing node extension.
- An incompatible modifier destroys the previous node extension and creates a new one.
- Reusing a `MountedNode` also preserves compatible modifier animation, gesture, and presentation state.
- Reordering modifiers is a semantic change and may recreate affected node extensions.

A third-party modifier can expose its node extension without changing `View`:

```cpp
class GlowExtension;

struct Glow {
  using Extension = GlowExtension;

  Color color;
  float radius = 12.0F;
};
```

The framework-provided adapter performs type erasure and dispatches typed updates:

```cpp
class GlowExtension final : public NodeExtension {
public:
  GlowExtension(MountedNode& node, const Glow& spec);

  void Update(MountedNode& node, const Glow& spec);

  void Paint(
      const MountedNode& node,
      PaintContext& context) const override;
};
```

The framework detects `Glow::Extension`, creates the node extension, and dispatches typed updates without requiring the modifier to expose descriptor or type-erasure details.

## NodeExtension lifecycle

`NodeExtension` operates directly on a controlled public `MountedNode`. There is no separate `ModifierHost` and no context object for every phase.

The current public lifecycle is:

```cpp
class NodeExtension {
public:
  struct FrameResult {
    bool needs_frame;
    std::optional<double> wake_after;
  };

  enum class PointerResult {
    Ignored,
    Observe,
    Handled,
    Capture,
  };

  virtual ~NodeExtension() = default;

  virtual FrameResult OnFrame(
      MountedNode& node,
      const FrameInfo& frame);

  virtual bool PrepareGeometry(MountedNode& node);

  virtual void OnScrollActivity(MountedNode& node);
  virtual void OnScrollGesture(MountedNode& node, bool active);

  virtual bool HitTest(
      MountedNode& node,
      Point position) const;

  virtual bool HoverHitTest(
      MountedNode& node,
      Point position) const;

  virtual void OnHoverChanged(MountedNode& node, bool hovered);
  virtual void OnFocusChanged(MountedNode& node, bool focused);
  virtual void OnKey(MountedNode& node, const KeyEvent& event);

  virtual PointerResult OnPointer(
      MountedNode& node,
      const PointerEvent& event);

  virtual void Paint(
      const MountedNode& node,
      PaintContext& context) const;

protected:
  void InvalidatePaint();
};
```

`Paint()` is currently a foreground pass after the View content and children. `NodeExtension` does not wrap measure, layout, or paint, and it has no `Next` continuations. Custom child measurement and placement belong to `Layout<Derived>` or `VirtualLayout<Derived>`.

`PrepareGeometry()` runs after final presentation transforms are resolved and before text services and paint consume geometry. It returns true only when the extension's foreground paint inputs changed. This phase lets geometry-dependent extensions retain value snapshots without storing raw mounted-node references or forcing clean PaintSequences to rerecord.

During `Paint()`, extensions append node-local PaintCommands through `PaintContext`. Runtime stores the resulting foreground PaintSequence on the node's RenderNode, and platform renderers apply the inherited layout and presentation transform while traversing RenderScene. Paint may extend beyond `Bounds()` unless an explicit clip limits it, and Runtime derives render visibility from recorded PaintSequence bounds and visible descendants. `PresentationBounds()` is the transformed axis-aligned host-view logical layout bounds. Pointer positions delivered to `NodeExtension::HitTest()` and `OnPointer()` are mapped back into the node's local coordinate space.

Clean content and foreground PaintSequences remain attached to their stable RenderNode. An extension calls `InvalidatePaint()` after changing paint-visible retained state; the operation invalidates only its owner's foreground sequence and schedules a frame when called outside frame construction.
During frame construction, the current recording pass consumes that invalidation and `FrameResult` remains the only extension-controlled source of follow-up scheduling.

The existing `LayoutContext` and `VirtualLayoutContext` remain because they represent real child measurement sessions.

## MountedNode capabilities

The public `MountedNode` surface exposes controlled operations needed by layouts and modifiers:

```cpp
class MountedNode {
public:
  Size LayoutSize() const;
  Rect Bounds() const;
  Point LayoutOffset() const;
  Rect PresentationBounds() const;
  float PresentationOpacity() const;
  bool IsEnabled() const;
  bool IsFocused() const;

  std::size_t ChildCount() const;
  MountedNode& ChildAt(std::size_t index);
  const MountedNode& ChildAt(std::size_t index) const;

  template <class Key>
  const typename Key::Value* LayoutValue() const;

  template <class T, class... Arguments>
  T& Cache(Arguments&&... arguments);
};
```

`Bounds()` has a zero origin and the node's layout size. `LayoutOffset()` is parent-relative. `PresentationBounds()` is derived from the committed ancestor transform chain for native-boundary queries and diagnostics.

It does not expose Runtime ownership, Environment storage, reconciliation internals, or direct child insertion and removal. A `NodeExtension` requests a continuing frame or a delayed wake-up through the `FrameResult` returned from `OnFrame()` and uses its protected paint invalidation operation when retained visual state changes. General application-facing measure and layout invalidation APIs are deferred.

## Frame lifecycle

The frame sequence is:

```text
apply State invalidations
recompose dirty scopes
reconcile ViewSpec and MountedNode
advance scroll motion
measure
layout
refresh interaction state
advance retained node extensions and prepare geometry
resolve presentation properties
bring focused text input into view
refresh the text-input session
record dirty PaintSequences
compute damage
return FrameCommit with RenderFrame and an optional absolute deadline
invalidate and present native damage
schedule the returned deadline
```

The current Runtime reuses clean measurement and placement results, retains clean content and foreground PaintSequences, and changes a RenderNode revision only when its commands or scene properties change. PaintSequence revisions and lightweight committed-scene snapshots produce conservative DamageRegion rectangles. Node-extension frame traversal caches whether a subtree contains any extensions and skips extension-free subtrees. A modifier that is waiting for a delayed transition schedules one wake-up rather than running empty frames.
Runtime may request a platform frame when state changes outside frame construction, but never calls the platform scheduler from inside `BuildFrame()`.
Continuous animation and delayed extension work are returned in `FrameCommit::next_frame_deadline`, allowing each host to present the current commit before arming the next frame.

Runtime calls fixed node and modifier lifecycle functions. It does not contain branches for concrete features such as ScrollBar, Ripple, Dialog, or a particular animation.

The retained scene and incremental invalidation architecture are defined in [Incremental Layout and Rendering Design](incremental-rendering.md).
Local geometry, the scene boundary, PaintSequence reuse, transform and opacity presentation updates, retained ScrollView movement, layout and virtual-realization caching, equality-aware modifier and layout-value diffs, and precise shared-runtime damage are implemented.
macOS and Windows consume shared DamageRegion output for native partial redraw.
Android retains the same shared damage calculation and committed-scene path but currently invalidates its complete native View.

## Animation model

Animation is separated into motion parameters and animated modifier values. Visibility transitions are deferred.

### AnimationSpec

`AnimationSpec` describes how a value moves:

```cpp
using AnimationSpec = std::variant<
    SnapSpec,
    TweenSpec,
    SpringSpec>;
```

Keyframes, decay animation, and visibility transitions remain follow-up work.

Examples:

```cpp
TweenSpec{
    .duration = 0.2,
    .easing = Easing::EaseOut,
};
```

```cpp
SpringSpec{
    .stiffness = 320.0F,
    .damping_ratio = 0.82F,
};
```

`AnimationSpec` is a value. It is not a modifier and does not own runtime state.

### Animated modifier values

`AnimateTo()` combines a target with an animation description:

```cpp
template <class T>
struct Animated {
  T target;
  AnimationSpec animation;
};
```

Modifiers can accept either immediate or animated values:

```cpp
return Panel().With(
    Offset{
        AnimateTo(
            target_offset,
            SpringSpec{
                .stiffness = 320.0F,
                .damping_ratio = 0.82F,
            }),
    },
    Opacity{
        AnimateTo(
            visible ? 1.0F : 0.0F,
            TweenSpec{
                .duration = 0.2,
            }),
    },
    Scale{
        AnimateTo(
            visible ? 1.0F : 0.92F,
            SpringSpec{}),
    },
    Rotation{
        AnimateTo(
            selected ? 8.0F : 0.0F,
            TweenSpec{.duration = 0.2}),
    });
```

The current value, velocity, start time, and target are stored in the compatible `NodeExtension`. Retargeting starts from the current presentation value. Advancing an animation does not recompose the component. Scale and Rotation default to the View center, use a normalized `TransformOrigin`, and share their transform with descendant drawing, clipping, foreground extensions, and pointer hit testing without changing Measure or Layout.

### Deferred transition model

`TransitionSpec` is a proposed insertion and removal model, not a current public API:

```cpp
TransitionSpec{
    .enter = {
        FadeTransition{
            TweenSpec{.duration = 0.18},
        },
        ScaleTransition{
            .from = 0.96F,
        },
    },
    .exit = {
        FadeTransition{
            TweenSpec{.duration = 0.14},
        },
    },
};
```

When a node with an exit transition disappears from the incoming tree, it enters a retained exit state:

```text
remove from the logical composition
    ↓
stop normal input delivery
    ↓
retain mounted presentation state
    ↓
run the exit transition
    ↓
unmount after completion
```

Dialog, BottomSheet, Menu, and Toast apply this lifecycle to Layer entries through a shared internal transition state when their active style enables motion. They reuse `AnimationSpec`, `AnimatedValue`, frame scheduling, reduced-motion resolution, and retained presentation properties rather than introducing a second animation engine. General View insertion and removal transitions remain proposed.

### Reduced motion

Accessibility and platform preferences enter through Environment. Theme motion resolution can replace animations with `SnapSpec` or shorter motion without changing each component.

## Interaction and indication

Pointer input follows one shared pipeline:

```text
PointerEvent
    ↓
hit testing and gesture arbitration
    ↓
clickable or gesture modifier
    ↓
InteractionState
    ↓
IndicationSpec
    ↓
mounted animation and paint
```

Interaction state is tracked per pointer ID:

```text
Press
Release
Cancel
```

A Press records the pointer ID and local press position. Release and Cancel refer to the corresponding Press. This supports multiple simultaneous pointers and multiple active ripple instances.

`OnClick()` and `.On<ViewEvents::Click>()` register the same typed event. Adding a Click handler makes the View participate in click interaction. Flat themes use a state-overlay indication, while Material themes select a ripple with a hover state layer. Default controls resolve their colors from `InteractionScheme` and their transition durations from `MotionScheme`; a typed component style can provide an explicit `IndicationSpec` when its foreground differs from the theme-wide state-layer color. Reduced-motion themes snap those transitions.

`Enabled` is a semantic modifier. Effective enabled state is resolved from the root toward its descendants, so a child cannot re-enable itself beneath a disabled parent. Disabled controls remain hit-test barriers without receiving pointer, scroll, focus, or Click interaction. A control that directly establishes the disabled boundary uses its component-specific disabled state colors. A non-control boundary applies disabled group opacity once; inherited descendants keep their enabled paint colors so the subtree is not dimmed again.

`Focusable` lets a custom View participate in the window focus order. Button is focusable by default. Runtime owns one focused mounted-node identity, dispatches `FocusChanged`, `KeyDown`, and `KeyUp`, and moves focus for Tab or Shift+Tab. Enter activates a focused Button on key down; Space shows pressed indication and activates on key up. Meaningful keyboard input, including an unmapped key reported as `Key::Unknown`, makes focus visible; the explicit Shift, Control, Alt, and Meta keys do not reveal a pointer-focused ring by themselves. Focus ring color, width, disabled opacity, and key indication timing resolve from Theme.

The topmost modal Layer is the active focus traversal root. Opening a nested modal captures the current focus, and dismissing it restores the previously focused mounted node when that node still exists and remains enabled.

When a pointer drag crosses the scroll threshold, the selected scroll container wins gesture arbitration. The original click target receives PointerCancel, Click is suppressed, and its indication runs the cancellation animation.

### IndicationSpec

Indications describe interaction visuals:

```cpp
using IndicationSpec = std::variant<
    NoIndication,
    StateOverlayIndication,
    RippleIndication>;
```

The default indication comes from Theme. A View can override it:

```cpp
return Button("Save").With(
    Indication{
        RippleIndication{
            .color = Color::White(),
        },
    });
```

A ripple is one mounted instance per Press. It continues expanding and fading after Release or Cancel until its configured transition finishes. Its PaintSequence clip uses the resolved component corner radius.

## ScrollBar as a modifier

ScrollBar is a View modifier:

```cpp
return VirtualList(items, ItemView).With(
    ScrollBar{});
```

Explicit values override Theme defaults:

```cpp
return VirtualList(items, ItemView).With(
    ScrollBar{
        .thickness = 8.0F,
        .minimum_thumb_extent = 32.0F,
    });
```

`ScrollBarExtension` owns:

- Opacity animation state.
- Delayed hide scheduling.
- Hover and drag state.
- Thumb geometry and pointer handling.
- Foreground painting.

Scroll activity, hover, and drag update this modifier. Runtime does not retain ScrollBar-specific animation or pointer functions.

## Environment

Environment is a typed, hierarchical value system:

```cpp
template <EnvironmentValue Value>
const Value& UseEnvironment();
```

The Environment value type is also its lookup identity and provides its fallback through `Value::Default()`.

```cpp
struct GreetingLocale {
  std::string language;

  static GreetingLocale Default() {
    return {"en"};
  }
};

const GreetingLocale& locale = UseEnvironment<GreetingLocale>();
return ProvideEnvironment(GreetingLocale{"fr"}, Content);
```

Use a semantic wrapper when two ambient values share the same underlying representation. Primitive or third-party representation types are not separate Environment keys by themselves.

Each Environment stores only local values and points to its parent:

```cpp
class Environment {
  std::shared_ptr<const Environment> parent_;
  std::unordered_map<std::type_index, std::any> local_values_;
};
```

Each composed subtree captures its current Environment. A nested provider shadows only the value type it supplies and inherits every other value through the shared parent chain.

Environment carries:

- Theme values.
- Platform and accessibility values.
- Per-window services.
- Other typed third-party values.

Theme and services reuse Environment rather than introducing parallel tree propagation systems.

## Theme

Theme is a direct, deferred subtree provider built on Environment:

```cpp
template <class Factory>
View Theme(
    ThemeDefinition definition,
    Factory&& content);
```

The content factory is stored and invoked only after the Theme Environment is active. This allows `UseTheme()` inside child component composition.

### Theme systems

Core semantic theme values include:

```cpp
struct ThemeSpec {
  ColorScheme colors;
  TypographyScheme typography;
  ShapeScheme shapes;
  SpacingScheme spacing;
  ElevationScheme elevation;
  MotionScheme motion;
  InteractionScheme interactions;
};
```

Component styles are typed Environment values:

```text
TextStyle
ButtonStyle
CheckboxStyle
RadioButtonStyle
SwitchStyle
ProgressCircleStyle
ProgressBarStyle
SliderStyle
DialogStyle
BottomSheetStyle
MenuStyle
ToastStyle
ScrollBarStyle
```

Third-party components can define their own style keys without extending a single global style registry.

Material, flat, liquid, and third-party themes are theme provider functions, not Runtime types and not subclasses:

```cpp
template <class Factory>
View MaterialTheme(Factory&& content)
{
  return Theme(
      MaterialThemeDefinition(),
      std::forward<Factory>(content));
}
```

```cpp
template <class Factory>
View XxxTheme(Factory&& content)
{
  return Theme(
      BuildXxxTheme(),
      std::forward<Factory>(content));
}
```

The built-in Flat and Material systems provide complete light and dark boundaries:

```cpp
FlatTheme(Content)
FlatDarkTheme(Content)
MaterialTheme(Content)
MaterialDarkTheme(Content)
```

`FlatLightThemeSpec()` and `FlatDarkThemeSpec()` return mutable token values that applications can use as the starting point for a branded flat theme. `MaterialLightThemeSpec()` and `MaterialDarkThemeSpec()` provide the corresponding Material tokens. Flat and Material Theme definitions explicitly register their complete Dialog, BottomSheet, Menu, and Toast styles rather than relying on presentation services to infer a style from ThemeSpec. Passing customized tokens to `FlatTheme(theme, factory)` or `MaterialTheme(theme, factory)` rebuilds that system's component styles from those tokens.

### Theme syntax

Pass a component function directly in the common case:

```cpp
return MaterialTheme(AppContent);
```

A content factory remains available when arguments must be captured:

```cpp
return MaterialTheme([=] {
  return AppContent(user_id);
});
```

`HUXERUI_THEME` is optional syntax sugar for an inline View expression or a component call with arguments:

```cpp
#define HUXERUI_THEME(ThemeProvider, ...)                              \
  (ThemeProvider)([=]() -> ::huxerui::View { return (__VA_ARGS__); })
```

Root usage:

```cpp
View App()
{
  return MaterialTheme(AppContent);
}
```

Nested usage:

```cpp
return HUXERUI_THEME(
    MaterialTheme,
    Column {
        Header(),
        HUXERUI_THEME(
            LiquidTheme,
            LiquidPanel()),
        Footer(),
    });
```

### Theme resolution

Theme resolution follows a fixed order:

```text
explicit View modifier
    ↓
nearest component style
    ↓
nearest Theme override
    ↓
nearest complete Theme
    ↓
root Theme
    ↓
platform defaults
```

A complete Theme establishes a design system boundary. A Theme override inherits unspecified values from its parent. Runtime does not branch on Material, flat, liquid, or third-party theme identity.

`ThemeDefinition{ThemeSpec}` establishes a complete boundary. `ThemeDefinition{}` only contributes its typed component values, so a nested style override does not replace the parent `ThemeSpec`. Text, Button, Dialog, Toast, ScrollBar, and default indications derive their semantic defaults from the nearest complete `ThemeSpec`. Component style lookup stops at that complete boundary, while a component-only `ThemeDefinition` continues to inherit from its parent. Explicit View modifiers run after semantic style resolution and win without a separate runtime style branch.

Built-in elevation styles keep `Shadow::offset` and `Shadow::spread` at zero so elevation remains a platform-neutral ambient effect. Custom drawing and explicit `Shadow` modifiers retain directional offset and spread when a design calls for a drop shadow rather than semantic elevation.

Material theme definitions map stable semantic roles into typed component styles. Surface-container colors, typography roles, and shape roles remain in `ThemeSpec`; control geometry, component-specific disabled colors, interaction target sizes, presentation motion, and surface composition remain in their owning styles. Runtime and platform renderers receive only the resolved View and PaintCommand data and never branch on Material identity.

Text uses `TextRole::Body`, `TextRole::Label`, and `TextRole::Title` to select the corresponding typography token. A component `TextStyle` value can still replace the complete Text style for a local subtree.

Theme switching initially updates values directly. Per-frame animated Theme interpolation is intentionally deferred.

## RuntimeRoot and the layer stack

`RuntimeRoot` owns the application content and one shared layer stack. This stack is the only global presentation container.

### LayerStack ownership and ordering

`RuntimeRoot` keeps the application root view directly and one internal `LayerStack`; it does not introduce an application host, slot, scope wrapper, or portal abstraction:

```text
RuntimeRoot
|-- application root view
`-- LayerStack
    |-- Presentation entries
    |-- Notification entries
    `-- System entries
```

Layer ordering describes broad drawing levels rather than concrete presentation components:

```cpp
enum class LayerLevel {
  Presentation,
  Notification,
  System,
};

enum class LayerPointerPolicy {
  PassThrough,
  Content,
  Barrier,
};

enum class LayerCancelPolicy {
  PassThrough,
  Consume,
  Dismiss,
};
```

`Presentation` contains Dialog, BottomSheet, Popup, and Menu entries. Entries at the same level follow attachment order, so a Menu opened from a Dialog appears above that Dialog. `Notification` contains transient messages such as Toast. `System` contains ordinary HuxerUI diagnostic UI such as the debug ribbon and performance panel. Runtime-owned `FrameworkOverlay` content, including text-selection handles and the editing toolbar, remains outside the public layer stack and is painted after it.

Layer options separate stacking, pointer behavior, focus containment, and dismissal:

```cpp
struct LayerOptions {
  LayerLevel level = LayerLevel::Presentation;
  LayerPointerPolicy pointer_policy = LayerPointerPolicy::Content;
  bool trap_focus = false;
  bool dismiss_on_outside_press = false;
  LayerCancelPolicy cancel_policy = LayerCancelPolicy::PassThrough;
  std::function<void()> on_dismiss_request;
  std::optional<Color> barrier_color;
};
```

Pointer `PassThrough` never participates in hit testing. `Content` allows uncovered areas to reach lower layers. `Barrier` consumes input outside the presented content and optionally requests dismissal. A dismissible or colored barrier requires `Barrier`.

Back routing checks the framework-owned text-selection overlay first and then visits public layers from top to bottom. `LayerCancelPolicy::PassThrough` continues to a lower entry, `Consume` stops without dismissal, and `Dismiss` invokes `on_dismiss_request` or removes the entry when no callback is present. Dialog, BottomSheet, Popup, and Menu map `dismiss_on_cancel = false` to `Consume`, so a visible interactive presentation never lets Back close content behind it or leave the native window. Toast and passive diagnostic content pass through. Future page navigation extends this same Runtime-owned chain after layers. Only a completely unhandled request reaches the platform fallback.

Desktop adapters map Escape through key dispatch. Android's full-screen `HuxerUIActivity` owns one lifecycle-bound Back callback and asks `Runtime::HandleBack()` before invoking its native fallback. `HuxerUIView` only exposes `handleBack()`; an embedded host decides when to call it and owns any unhandled behavior. Runtime never pushes Back-handler state into a platform adapter.

Focus follows actual paint order rather than raw insertion order. The topmost `trap_focus` entry excludes lower entries and application content from focus traversal while still allowing higher System content to interact. Dismissing Menu over Dialog restores Dialog focus; dismissing Dialog then restores the previous application focus when that node is still valid.

`LayerController::State` owns layer entries, identifiers, and attachment sequence. `LayerController` mutates that shared state directly and asks Runtime to invalidate the layer stack. Runtime owns the corresponding mounted nodes, layout, interaction tree, and RenderScene state. Disconnecting the controller clears retained factories and makes copies that outlive Runtime fail safely.

Application and layer invalidation remain separate:

```text
application_dirty -> compose the application root factory
layers_dirty      -> reconcile ordered LayerStack entries
dirty scope       -> recompose only that mounted scope
```

Attaching, updating, or dismissing a LayerEntry must not execute the application root factory. Each entry owns an independent `RecomposeScope`. Application composition may attach an entry that is included later in the same frame. Mutations after the layer snapshot schedule another frame instead of recursively composing layers.

Concrete presentation policy remains outside Runtime. Typed per-window services build entries on the common controller:

```text
UseToast()       -> Notification, pass-through, timed bottom placement
UseDialog()      -> Presentation, modal barrier, theme-controlled vertical placement
UseBottomSheet() -> Presentation, modal barrier, bottom content
UsePopup()       -> Presentation, anchored arbitrary content
UseMenu()        -> Presentation, anchored menu semantics and focus
```

These typed handles are the primary public interaction model. Having several discoverable `UseXxx()` functions does not create several layer systems; each service shares LayerController, ordering, Environment capture, focus, input, and invalidation. The design does not add a generic `UsePresentation()`, public `UseModal()`, `UseLayers()`, or declarative portal solely to reduce the number of typed entry points.

`UseXxx()` captures the current Environment while composing and returns a lightweight handle that can be retained by an event callback. Showing content later uses that captured Theme, Locale, resources, and third-party values. Services installed through RootHook use the root Environment unless their typed handle captures a narrower one.

Popup and Menu handles expose a retained anchor modifier and point-based presentation:

```cpp
auto menu = UseMenu();

return Button("More")
    .With(menu.Anchor())
    .OnClick([menu] {
      menu.Show({
          MenuItem("Rename", [] {}),
          MenuSection{},
          MenuItem("Delete", [] {}),
      });
    });
```

The anchor modifier records final PresentationBounds without creating a layer. `Show()` attaches the entry and follows those bounds. `ShowAt()` supports context menus and pointer-position popups. Each Popup or Menu handle retains at most one active entry; presenting through it again dismisses the previous entry before attaching the replacement. `PopupContext` dismisses arbitrary popup content directly, while Menu leaf actions dismiss the complete open menu chain automatically. Anchor movement invalidates only the corresponding layer entry placement, settles that layout path before the current frame commit, and damages the old and new bounds; anchor removal dismisses the entry. Placement combines a preferred side, cross-axis alignment, gap, offset, viewport margin, opposite-side fallback, and final clamping without introducing a general cross-tree layout dependency.

Menu is structurally distinct from Popup. Its public input is a recursive sequence of `MenuEntry` values created implicitly from `MenuItem` and `MenuSection`. Menu items directly contain either an action or another entry sequence, while `MenuSection{}` is a non-interactive logical boundary whose visual treatment belongs to the theme. Items retain resource identifiers and image assets as semantic values; the presentation service resolves resources from the captured Environment and composes themed surfaces and interaction. The root menu owns the transparent outside-press barrier. Submenus are content-only anchored layers, so their parent menu remains interactive; Back closes the deepest open level, the default outside-press behavior closes the complete chain, and opening another submenu replaces only that level and its descendants. Arbitrary custom anchored content remains a Popup responsibility.

Dialog and BottomSheet use their own typed handles rather than a shared public Modal mode. They share private barrier, focus, Cancel, dismissal, Environment, and retained Layer transition machinery, while their layout, surface, motion, and options remain component-specific. Dialog resolves placement and motion from `DialogStyle`, while BottomSheet owns an adaptive-width bottom surface that translates from the window edge. The command-oriented `UseDialog()` path remains the primary ergonomic model.

The built-in debug overlay attaches one persistent System entry after root hooks have installed application services and global components. Its top-right corner ribbon toggles an upper-left metrics panel within the entry's own state. Both are composed from ordinary Views; the ribbon is one rotated component clipped by the viewport rather than separately positioned background and label geometry. Toggling or sampling the panel must not reconcile the application root or damage the full viewport. Runtime records painted-frame count, frame-commit time, and damage ratio in a dedicated debug metrics state. PlatformAdapter optionally supplies cumulative process CPU time, a platform-preferred process-memory footprint, and logical processor count so interval utilization can be derived without platform state leaking into LayerController.

The sampling modifier is mounted only with the expanded panel. It wakes once per second and updates the panel's local scope. That update is an ordinary painted frame, keeping the metric tied to actual work without coupling Runtime accounting to the overlay's reconciliation timing. Collapsing the panel removes the modifier and its deadline, so a static application does not animate merely because the debug ribbon is enabled.

LayerController entries without a transition are removed immediately. Dialog, BottomSheet, Menu, and Toast entries with configured motion first become non-interactive, retain their presentation state through the exit animation, and are removed after completion. Modal barriers remain until actual removal, so focus cannot be restored and content behind a visually exiting modal cannot be activated early.

## RootHook

A RootHook installs per-window services or persistent global components before the first application composition:

```cpp
using RootHook = std::function<void(RootContext&)>;
```

`RootContext` has two capabilities:

```cpp
class RootContext {
public:
  template <class Service>
  void Provide(std::shared_ptr<Service> service);

  LayerController& Layers();
};
```

Installation uses `AppOptions`:

```cpp
HUXERUI_APP(
    App,
    {
        .root_hooks = {
            InstallXxxToast(),
        },
    })
```

A service hook can be a function:

```cpp
RootHook InstallXxxToast(XxxToastOptions options = {})
{
  return [options](RootContext& root) {
    root.Provide(
        std::make_shared<XxxToastService>(
            root.Layers(),
            options));
  };
}
```

A persistent global component can attach through `LayerController`:

```cpp
RootHook InstallGlobalBanner()
{
  return [](RootContext& root) {
    root.Layers().Attach(
        LayerOptions{
            .level = LayerLevel::System,
            .pointer_policy = LayerPointerPolicy::PassThrough,
        },
        GlobalBanner);
  };
}
```

Services are stored in the root Environment and retrieved through a typed helper:

```cpp
auto service = UseService<XxxToastService>();
```

Duplicate service types are rejected rather than silently replaced.

Root hooks run once in declaration order. Runtime owns the provided services and attached entries. On window destruction, Runtime removes content and layers before destroying services in reverse registration order. A service uses its destructor to release external subscriptions.

HuxerUI installs its built-in Toast, Dialog, BottomSheet, Popup, and Menu services for every Runtime before application root hooks run. Applications use their typed `UseXxx()` handles directly; root hooks remain the extension mechanism for third-party services and global components. When `AppOptions::show_debug_overlay` is enabled, Runtime installs the built-in DebugOverlay after all root hooks so its System entry remains above other global layers. The option defaults to enabled in Debug builds and disabled in Release builds.

RootHook does not provide:

- Direct Runtime access.
- Direct MountedNode insertion.
- Per-frame callbacks.
- Root replacement.
- Dynamic installation and removal.

## Theme-driven presentation policy

Status: implemented for standard Dialog and theme-owned Dialog, BottomSheet, Menu, and Toast presentation policy

The shared LayerStack foundation owns presentation lifetime, ordering, focus, barriers, Cancel routing, outside-press handling, Environment capture, and removal. It must not also define a single visual structure for every Theme.

Presentation is divided into three contracts:

```text
semantic request
    Dialog title, message, and actions
    Menu items, sections, and submenus
    Toast message
        -> theme presentation policy
    structure, surface, geometry, placement, and motion
        -> window presentation lifetime
    Layer entry, focus, barrier, dismissal, and scheduling
```

Runtime and LayerController only implement the final contract. Typed services resolve the captured Theme, compose the themed content, and attach it to the shared LayerStack. No layer or Runtime code checks whether a Theme is Material, Flat, iOS, MIUI, or third-party.

`ThemeDefinition` continues to carry typed component styles. A presentation style is a complete value description rather than only a color bundle. Depending on the component, it may describe:

- Surface background, shape, shadow, and size constraints.
- Typography, padding, spacing, alignment, and action arrangement.
- Separator policy and item treatment.
- Default window or anchor placement and viewport margins.
- Enter and exit motion.

The framework composes these semantic values through ordinary HuxerUI Views. A Theme does not receive arbitrary Layer access, own dismissal callbacks, or replace a presentation service. Theme values also do not contain application actions.

`PresentationMotion` is a public Theme value shared by presentation styles, while motion execution remains private to presentation. An absent optional motion disables the transition; otherwise neutral scale and slide values express a fade, and non-neutral values add scale or placement-relative translation without a second motion-kind hierarchy. The implementation interpolates opacity, scale, translation, and transform origin through `AnimationSpec`, retained Layer transition state, and presentation properties. Dialog, Menu, and Toast derive motion from their styles; BottomSheet maps its component-specific motion values into the same private executor.

Menu motion direction and transform origin derive from the requested anchor placement. Making the origin follow a runtime fallback to the opposite side remains follow-up work because the resolved side currently belongs to LayerStack layout rather than the semantic Menu request.

Theme policy does not erase semantic component identity:

- Dialog remains modal content with focus containment and a barrier.
- BottomSheet remains an edge-attached modal surface.
- Menu remains an anchored semantic item hierarchy.
- Popup remains arbitrary anchored content.
- Toast remains a transient notification.

Custom View factories are escape hatches for application-specific content. They still receive themed outer placement, scrim, and motion where appropriate, but they do not implicitly receive the standard component's surface, padding, or internal layout.

### Standard Dialog model

Dialog supports standard title-and-message requests in addition to custom View factories. A standard request has one positive action and may have one negative action. Empty callbacks retain the normal dismissal behavior without adding application work.

The standard model allows Theme to select a native-feeling arrangement without inspecting application content:

- Material can use a centered surface with trailing horizontal actions.
- Flat can use a compact desktop surface and its own button treatment.
- iOS can center content blocks, stretch actions, and place separators between them.
- MIUI can use a different viewport position and slide or scale motion.

Positive and negative semantics provide styling and arrangement information without exposing a general action model. Either action requests dismissal through the normal retained exit path and then invokes its non-empty callback; actual Layer removal still completes after the exit animation. A custom interaction that must keep the Dialog open uses the custom `DialogFactory` form.

The command-oriented API provides compact overloads for the common single-action case:

```cpp
auto dialog = UseDialog();

dialog.Show("Network unavailable", "Check your connection and try again.");

dialog.Show(
    "Save changes?",
    "The current document has unsaved changes.",
    "Save",
    [] {
      SaveDocument();
    });
```

Both overloads construct the same internal standard Dialog request. They do not bypass Theme resolution or create another service path. Public parameter naming follows `positive`, `negative`, `on_positive_click`, and `on_negative_click`.

`Show(title, message)` creates one default positive action whose only behavior is dismissal. Supplying a positive label and callback adds application behavior to that same action. The two-action overload requires both labels so it cannot be ambiguous with the compact form.

An empty positive label falls back to `OK`, while an empty negative label in the two-action overload falls back to `Cancel`. Migrating these framework-owned strings into the built-in resource bundle remains part of framework localization rather than introducing a temporary public label Environment value. Explicit `StringResource` inputs resolve through the same resource context as other deferred presentation content.

The two-action form remains compact:

```cpp
dialog.Show(
    "Delete item?",
    "This action cannot be undone.",
    "Delete",
    "Cancel",
    DeleteItem
);
```

`StringVariant` is the shared deferred display-string representation for Dialog, Toast, and Menu. It owns direct text or a `StringResource` plus positional arguments. Ordinary Text, Button, TextField placeholder, and Validation construction keep direct strings or explicit `UseString` resolution, so immediate component declarations do not pay for a deferred wrapper.

`DialogStyle` is the complete standard Dialog presentation policy. It covers the modal scrim, default placement, viewport margins, enter and exit motion, surface appearance and width constraints, content padding and alignment, title and message styles, action direction and alignment, positive and negative action appearance and indication, and action separator policy.

The existing custom factory remains available:

```cpp
dialog.Show([](DialogContext dialog) {
  return CustomDialogContent(dialog);
});
```

This path uses themed modal placement, scrim, and motion but leaves the custom content's own surface and internal layout untouched.

Declarative custom Dialog presentation and command-created Dialogs share style resolution, Layer entry, and the retained dismissal path. The declarative modifier accepts custom content; its visibility remains controlled state, so outside press and Cancel request a source-state update rather than directly overriding it.

### Menu presentation policy

Menu already receives semantic `MenuItem` and `MenuSection` values. `MenuSection` remains a logical boundary: Theme may render it as a separator, spacing, or no visible element.

`MenuStyle` controls menu surface and item treatment, including foreground and background colors, item indication, shape, shadow, icon geometry, padding, minimum metrics, separator policy, and root or submenu motion. The menu surface clips descendants to its rounded bounds so edge-to-edge item feedback cannot escape the shape. `MenuOptions` owns call-specific anchor placement, gap, viewport margin, offset, and width decisions.

The service retains ownership of submenu chains, focus, outside press, Cancel routing, action dispatch, and automatic chain dismissal. Theme cannot change those behavioral guarantees.

### Toast presentation policy

`ToastStyle` controls surface background, text style, padding, shape, shadow, maximum width, viewport margins, top or bottom placement, and enter and exit motion. Toast duration, timed dismissal, queueing, and deduplication remain service policy rather than Theme values.

The message-only API remains the common entry point. Future semantic actions or icons extend the Toast request model rather than requiring callers to construct the Theme's internal View layout.

## Toast

Toast is naturally command-oriented:

```cpp
auto toast = UseToast();

return Button("Save")
    .OnClick([toast] {
      toast.Show("Saved");
    });
```

`UseToast()` returns a lightweight handle bound to the current window and captures the current Environment. A Toast shown from a nested Theme uses that Theme by default.

The Toast service creates one LayerEntry per call and manages its duration. The Runtime layer stack owns composition, input behavior, and removal. Queueing and deduplication are deferred policies.

There is no process-global `Toast::Show()` because it would be ambiguous in multi-window and multi-Runtime applications.

## Dialog

Dialog supports both declarative and command-oriented usage.

Declarative presentation is a modifier:

```cpp
return Content().With(
    Dialog {
        .visible = show_dialog,
        .content = ConfirmDialog,
        .dismiss_on_outside_press = true,
        .on_dismiss_request = [show_dialog] {
          show_dialog = false;
        },
    });
```

`DialogExtension` owns a LayerEntry handle. Updating the modifier updates the entry and can reverse an in-progress exit from its current presentation value. Destroying the source modifier requests the same retained dismissal used by command-created dialogs.

An outside press requests dismissal instead of directly removing a declarative Dialog layer. The callback updates the source State, preserving one source of truth for both the component and layer stack. A dismissible declarative Dialog must provide `on_dismiss_request`.

Command-oriented presentation uses a per-window service:

```cpp
auto dialog = UseDialog();

return Button("Delete")
    .OnClick([dialog] {
      dialog.Show([](DialogContext dialog) {
        return Column {
          Text("Delete item?"),
          Button("Cancel").OnClick([dialog] {
            dialog.Dismiss();
          }),
        };
      });
    });
```

`DialogContext` identifies the presented instance and lets command-created content dismiss itself without capturing a `LayerId` before `Show()` returns.

Both forms use the same modal LayerEntry implementation:

- Modal barrier.
- Focus capture and restoration.
- Outside-press dismissal policy.
- Captured Environment and Theme.

Dialog does not own a separate Runtime or presentation host.

## Theme and global presentation

Root services are installed before application composition and inherited through nested Environments.

A global presentation handle obtained inside themed content captures the caller Environment:

```cpp
[[huxerui::scope]]
View AppContent()
{
  auto toast = UseToast();

  return Button("Save")
      .OnClick([toast] {
        toast.Show("Saved");
      });
}

View App()
{
  return MaterialTheme(AppContent);
}
```

The resulting Toast entry receives the Material Theme frame even though it is mounted in the window layer stack outside the normal content layout hierarchy.

A presentation API may explicitly request the root Theme for application-wide alerts, but caller Theme is the default.

## Extension map

The current extension points are:

| Requirement | Extension mechanism |
| --- | --- |
| Custom layout | `Layout<Derived>`, `LayoutContext`, `LayoutResult` |
| Custom virtual container | `VirtualLayout<Derived>` and `VirtualLayoutContext` |
| Custom event | `Event<Arguments...>`, `On<Key>()`, `UseEvents()`, and `Emit<Key>()` |
| Custom View effect | Modifier value and `NodeExtension` |
| Custom animation | `AnimationSpec` or animated modifier value |
| Custom interaction visual | `IndicationSpec` and `NodeExtension` |
| Custom text input or selection | `TextInputClient`, `TextSelectionClient`, and `NodeExtension` |
| Custom theme | `XxxTheme(factory)` wrapping `Theme()` |
| Per-window service | RootHook and `RootContext::Provide()` |
| Global component | RootHook and `LayerController` |
| Typed presentation library | A service backed by the Runtime LayerStack |

Built-in and third-party implementations use the same lifecycle and storage models.

## Performance rules

The architecture follows these rules:

- Animation advances mounted state and does not recompose components every frame.
- Node extension frame traversal skips subtrees that contain no retained extensions after the extension-tree cache is rebuilt.
- Delayed animation work schedules one wake-up instead of polling.
- Environment values are captured during composition; the current runtime does not maintain per-key Environment dependency subscriptions.
- Layer entries use independent scopes.
- ScrollBar state exists only on Views that install the modifier.
- Pointer interaction state is stored per pointer ID.
- Explicit style values override Theme without mutating Theme.
- A service belongs to one window root.

Incremental layout and retained rendering are specified separately in [Incremental Layout and Rendering Design](incremental-rendering.md).
The implemented pipeline coordinates mounted geometry, extension painting, Runtime frame output, and platform renderers under that contract.

## Deliberately omitted abstractions

The current design does not introduce:

- `ModifierHost`.
- A context class for every modifier lifecycle phase.
- Runtime branches for ScrollBar, Ripple, Dialog, or concrete animations.
- `OverlayBehavior`.
- Separate Overlay and Presentation runtime trees.
- A Host type for every global component.
- `AppFeature` or `MountedRootFeature`.
- `RootRegistration`.
- A public parallel ServiceRegistry.
- Theme class inheritance.
- Runtime checks for Material, flat, liquid, or third-party themes.
- Process-global Toast or Dialog singletons.
- Dynamic RootHook installation and removal.
- Arbitrary numeric layer z-index.
- Animated Theme interpolation in the initial implementation.

## Implemented adoption sequence

The foundation was introduced through the following sequence:

- Add the generic modifier descriptor and node extension reconciliation.
- Move ScrollBar frame, pointer, and paint state into a node extension.
- Add generic invalidation flags and prune inactive frame subtrees.
- Add typed hierarchical Environment values and direct Theme providers.
- Add the synthetic RuntimeRoot and shared layer stack.
- Add RootHook service installation.
- Build Dialog and Toast on the layer stack.
- Separate application and LayerStack composition, add level ordering, and build BottomSheet, Popup, Menu, and DebugOverlay on the shared controller.
- Add interaction indications and public animation values.
- Migrate common View styling to `With()` modifier values.
