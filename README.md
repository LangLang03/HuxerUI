HuxerUI brings a functional, declarative UI model to C++20. Android, iOS, Linux, macOS, Windows, and the Web technical preview share the same state, recomposition, layout, input, scrolling, text editing, animation, and retained-scene runtime while retaining platform-specific integration, text systems, and renderers.

## Why HuxerUI

| Declarative C++ | Shared Runtime | Native Integration |
|---|---|---|
| Compose interfaces with ordinary C++ functions, typed state, events, themes, and modifiers. | Reuse one implementation of reconciliation, layout, interaction, virtualization, animation, and text editing. | Integrate through Android View, UIKit, AppKit, Win32, X11, or an Emscripten Canvas while preserving platform services. |

HuxerUI includes Row, Column, Flow, Stack, ScrollView, virtual lists and grids, responsive viewport classes, Tabs, controlled text editing, selection, validation, Flat and Material themes, retained animation, shadows, Canvas and Path drawing, typed app resources, Image, Toast, Dialog, BottomSheet, Popup, Menu, custom layouts, and typed extension points.

## Quick Start

```cpp
#include <huxerui/huxerui.h>

using namespace huxerui;

[[huxerui::scope]]
View Counter() {
  auto count = UseState(0);

  return Column {
    Text::Format("Count: {}", count),
    Button("+1").OnClick([count] {
      count += 1;
    }),
  }.With(
      Padding(24.0F),
      Spacing(12.0F)
  );
}

View App() {
  return MaterialTheme(Counter);
}

HUXERUI_APP(
    App,
    {
        .title = "Counter",
        .width = 480.0F,
        .height = 320.0F,
    }
)
```

Add the application target. The helper links HuxerUI and enables scope generation:

```cmake
huxerui_add_app(my_app
        SOURCES
            main.cpp
)
```

Build the repository on macOS or Linux:

```bash
cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug
cmake --build build --parallel
ctest --test-dir build --output-on-failure
```

Top-level builds also produce the `huxerui` CLI:

```bash
huxerui create hello_huxer --platform android,ios,windows,macos,web
huxerui doctor
huxerui devices ios
huxerui open ios
huxerui build windows
huxerui run windows
```

The CLI creates and validates source-controlled platform shells, including a native Xcode project for iOS, discovers Android and iOS devices, builds enabled Android, iOS Simulator or physical-device, Windows, macOS, and Web targets from compatible hosts, and launches development artifacts.
The CMake install exports a platform-specific SDK package, the CLI, and host code generators.
Android and Web CLI projects currently build against a source SDK checkout. iOS accepts either a source checkout or an installed SDK built for the selected Apple SDK and architectures; versioned mobile distribution artifacts, package commands, and module integration remain staged work.

See [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) for application setup, platform builds, CMake options, code generation, and example launch commands.

## Architecture

```text
declarative components and State
  -> ViewSpec
  -> reconciliation
  -> MountedNode
  -> measure, layout, input, and animation
  -> RenderScene
  -> native renderer
```

The platform layer owns the native window or View, frame scheduling, input services, text services, and drawing surface. Shared application code does not depend on native UI objects.
